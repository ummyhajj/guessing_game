Game Improvement 1

Phil, our hypothetical client has been enjoying the game we built for him. Unfortunately phil is unable to quit the game cleanly. He's told to press CTR + C to quit the game but doing so crashes the game instead. 


Your task is provide a fix for this such that when phill presses CTR + C, the game can exit cleanly with no errors. 

The problem occurs because getUserInput() throws an exception when CTR + C is pressed so you have to handle this exception and break out of the loop. This will effectively get us out of the while loop and the game can exit cleanly. I have annotated the part of the code where the changes need to be made.

If you solve this proble you'll learn two things:

1. How to break out of loops 
2. Exception handling in python. (Exception is just another name for errors).
